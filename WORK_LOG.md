My thinking was basically just going through the string named sequence, then if I saw a key in the string, then while it didn't end I would keep counting keys until it ends. I'm thinking about how this would improve, since I don't really know whatever new thing we are going to learn to help us complete this problem set. |

I noticed it's taking a very long time to run; I started running it during lunch at like 12:00, then I came back and my battery drained almost 70% and it took like 3 hours to run. |

I'm thinking that I could change the for loop to a while loop and just move the variable i to the end of the sequence instead. I noticed that it counts overlapping and nonoverlapping STRs so I don't think skipping is a good idea, since I might be missing some of the STR if it overlaps. Yeah I'm kind of stuck and don't know how to think about this further, since the 200,000 character chromosome is taking centuries to run with for loops, but testTricky doesn't work with skipping. |

I'm wondering how I should have my code shift the window efficiently. |
| October 23 |  4:00 - 6:00  | I figured out how going through the string sequence works, starting with hash(str) since we need to know what number is represented by the STR sequence, then starting with the sequence[0, strLength - 1] then we can see what value those letters have, and compare it to our actual str value. I think this makes sense when thinking about it, since going through the 'T' * R is removed, and then adding a 'c' to make the new string by going through instead of going through linearly based on the length of the sequence, which will allow the code to run faster. I need to figure out how to avoid the index out of bounds. I don't know why but only the first 3 tests run, the other 3 failed. I looked at the slides and I see that its supposed to shift the window, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong with the rolling hash, I think that its the way I'm going through the hash. I figured it out, I think it's since I'm using substring instead of using an actual moving window thingy. |

I think it might be because of the inefficiency. I am going to attempt to pinpoint where is causing the long calculation time. |

I realized I needed to consider when repeats occur back to back and how the rolling hash would update while checking for consecutive repeats. |

I thought about how overlapping STRS could fail if I skip positions incorrectly. |

I'm thinking about how my rolling has is not working properly and why its not O(1) efficiency. |

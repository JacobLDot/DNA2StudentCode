My thinking was basically just going through the string named sequence, then if I saw a key in the string, then while it didn't end I would keep counting keys until it ends. I'm thinking about how this would improve, since I don't really know whatever new thing we are going to learn to help us complete this problem set. |

I noticed it's taking a very long time to run; I started running it during lunch at like 12:00, then I came back and my battery drained almost 70% and it took like 3 hours to run. |

I'm wondering how I should have my code shift the window efficiently. |
| October 23 |  4:00 - 6:00  | I figured out how going through the string sequence works, starting with hash(str) since we need to know what number is represented by the STR sequence, then starting with the sequence[0, strLength - 1] then we can see what value those letters have, and compare it to our actual str value. I think this makes sense when thinking about it, since going through the 'T' * R is removed, and then adding a 'c' to make the new string by going through instead of going through linearly based on the length of the sequence, which will allow the code to run faster. |

I realized I needed to consider when repeats occur back to back and how the rolling hash would update while checking for consecutive repeats. |

I'm thinking about how my rolling has is not working properly and why its not O(1) efficiency. |
| November 1 | 11:00 - 12:00 |                                                                              I realized my code is rehashing the substring every time inside the while loop, which makes the code very slow. Additionally, I was thinking about how I was able to pass 5/6 test cases which was since the long case immediately went out of bounds. To fix the hashing, I think I should roll forward by strLength characters. My thinking led me to the discovery that I'm supposed to skip the counted parts if I found an STR in the sequence that I was looking at, which fixed my code. |
